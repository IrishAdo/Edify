 * A Cache library that will allow you to differenticate the type of information
 * that you are caching.  90+% of content on most pages can be cached.  Caching
 * allows the webserver to serve more pages per second as we release the CPU
 * quicker.  This cache library also knows about Langauge so that it can tell
 * which cached file to load for index.html based on the language of the site.
 *
 * This library will cache the following types of content.
 *
 * - pages - pages are normally cached for a period of time default is 5 minutes.
 *
 * - static - cached forever or until something changes it.  The web page will
 *   not generate these files they are produced by back end systems.  which
 *   could be on the same server or another server and rSynced to the webserver
 *
 * @example  $status = Cache::checkPage("index.html",300);
